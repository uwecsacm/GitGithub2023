# GitGithub2023
For our yearly git github night!
This year we are doing an interactive project where each team is assigned one of the following problems to complete and then contribute back to the repo!

Tickets for this Sprint:
- Feature: Users want to be able to draw a circle. should have an orange interior and orange outline. Should have a radius of 60 and work like the other shapes
- Users would like the line to be green
- Bug: The rectangle is creating a line currently. It should be a 100x100 square
